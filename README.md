# Presidential Election Data Visualization

### About
The project allows someone to pick a presidential election going back to 1940 and a state, and see the major candidates' vote totals in a bar graph. On the bar graph, the x-axis is the candidates and the y-axis is the votes.

### Technologies Used
The project is written using python because of it's data capabilities. The pandas and matplotlib libraries are also used for their data reading and visualization capabilities.

### Background
As I continue to learn about the intersection of politics and technology, and as I seek to work in political technology, I created this project to get better at political data visualization.

### Installation
Navigate to the green "<> Code" dropdown button in the top right corner of the repository. Click the "Download ZIP" button. Unzip the project. You should be able to open the "main.py" file in an editor, import the neccessary libraries based on the editor's instructions, and run the file.

### How to Use
The program first prompts the user for a year and then for a state via the console. Once inputted, the program displays a bar graph of each major candidates' vote totals in that state in that year.
