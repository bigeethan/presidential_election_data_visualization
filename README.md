As I continue to learn about the intersection of politics and technology, and as I seek to work in political technology, I created this project to get better at political data visualization.

The project is to allow someone to pick a presidential election going back to 1940 and a state, and see the major candidates' vote totals.

The program prompts the user for a year and then a state. Once inputted, the program displays a bar graph of each major candidates' vote totals in that state in that year.
